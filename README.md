# Perceptron Logic Gate Implementations and Graph Search Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various logic gates using perceptrons and graph traversal algorithms in Python. The logic gates implemented are AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. The graph traversal algorithms include Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).
